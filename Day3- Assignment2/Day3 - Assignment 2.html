    <h2> Difference between var, let and const</h2>
    <h4> Variable</h4>
    <p> <b>var </b> means Variable, which is globally scoped. Globally Scoped means, var is declared outside the 
        block of function.</p>
    <script>
        var intro = "hello vinothini!";
    function func() {
        var intro = "vinothini";
    }
    console.log(intro);
    </script>
    <p> Above, we can give the same the name is declared for two variable. But, in the output, 
        'hello vinothini' is displayed. Beacuse, var is globally scoped. </p>

    <h4> Let</h4>
        <p> Anything within curly braces is a block. let is live in the block</p>
        <script>
            let intro1 = "say Hi";
            let times = 4;
            if (times > 3) {
                let hello1 = "say Hello instead";
                console.log(hello1);// "say Hello instead"
            }
            console.log(hello1); // hello is not defined;
        </script>
        <p> Using hello1 outside its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. This is because let variables are 
            block scoped . </p>

        <h4> Constant</h4>
        <p> Variables declared with the const maintain constant values.Every const declaration, therefore, must be initialized at the time of 
            declaration.</p>
        <script>
            const message = "Javascript Rowdies";
            console.log(message);
        </script>
